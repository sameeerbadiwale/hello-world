1. Estimated Bill - Dependency Itron data - Formula
2. Price Publish - Price Publish/Cast ( We cannot do price publish without Itron)
3. Usage Portlet - They took a year to build it
4. Include Security with the service call design 
5. Agree on the name (Monday) with Websphere/ESB
6. Add Shubha on the call on Monday
7. Scott will email to Security, Dan to follow up

Energy Use and cost- Sumesh/ISU needs to be engaged
Fields are not clear

8. Energy Usage data to pull - Monthly data instead of Yearly? Check performance pulling one Year, we need to rework if performance is not good
9. Risk: We may not have historical Temperature data from Teradata or any other source
10. Email would be in form of PDF - Customer service will not be able to see it, tech rep logs in and checks in
If Jim Does it, it is much faster.

11. myOGEPower Users - are we going to ask the users to create login's again?
Import - myOGEPower users, Disable signups?
Define what to do for customers in myOGEPower and not on OGE.com

SAP has the information on who has signed up for myOGEPower - they still may have a different email id between the teo
Scott will be helpful in that discussion with Kevin and Dan, Jessica, Terena

Approach has to be decided.
